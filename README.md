# Analysis-and-processing-of-Text-data-for-Sentiment-Analysis-

## Overview

This project focuses on conducting data analytics on diverse URLs to perform sentiment analysis. Leveraging Python programming and Beautiful Soup for web scraping, the project aims to extract textual data from specified URLs, analyze sentiment through polarity and subjectivity evaluation, and provide key insights contributing to the project's objectives.

## Project Structure

- **Data Extraction:**
  - Utilized Python programming with Beautiful Soup for web scraping to extract article titles and content from diverse URLs.
  - Implemented a systematic approach to ensure the exclusion of irrelevant website elements such as headers and footers.

- **Text Analysis:**
  - Conducted sentiment analysis on the extracted text data.
  - Evaluated polarity and subjectivity of the text content using Python programming.
  - Computed additional variables, including POSITIVE SCORE, NEGATIVE SCORE, PERCENTAGE OF COMPLEX WORDS, and PERSONAL PRONOUNS, among others.

## Project Files

- **Input Files:**
  - `input.xlsx`: Contains a list of URLs for data extraction.
  - `Text Analysis.docx`: Provides the definition of variables for text analysis.

- **Output Files:**
  - `Output Data Structure.xlsx`: Specifies the format for the output variables.

- **Code Files:**
  `Sentiment_Analysis_Text_Data.ipynb`:
  - Python script for extracting data from URLs using Beautiful Soup.
  -  Python script for conducting sentiment analysis and computing text variables.
